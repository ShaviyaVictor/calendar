- Another day in the office, today I have like 5 sessions and 2 tasks to complete and could proably get an additional one for IVR.
When I am afraid, I put my trust in the Lord.
Afterall, faith drives away fear and fear drives away faith!

- Just from a 2hr session for Deployment of the Subscription Service led by Andrew Hylton. 
A very informative session and insightful. 
But as usual, you mess up with it, you get to learn a bunch of stuff regarding how things go.
We are to continue with the session tomorrow.
Leaving for home now.
