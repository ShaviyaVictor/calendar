- So another day in the office, I have a couple of sessions today. I hope I make some progress with my tasks and have a PR created for the same tasks.
- Log4j migration should be done by end of day and know a way forward for the SIF null->account number task with Brown-Wryte and finish or at least do something with Luigi for the PrankCaller task for IVR team
- Today is Downtown chill day.
- The Deployment CD setup for Disney is a whole freaking process. Can blow your mind off for sure! We are having our third 2.5hr session today.

- Another day in the office, today I have like 5 sessions and 2 tasks to complete and could proably get an additional one for IVR.
When I am afraid, I put my trust in the Lord.
Afterall, faith drives away fear and fear drives away faith!
- Just started my 2hr meeting for Production Deployment for Subscription Service that is to go support Disney Apps.
For the Replace null with Account number story task that I am working jointly with Shemar Brown-Write, 
we've hit rock-bottom with Brown saying it's now gotten to a place where we are looking for a pin in a hay-stack.
- Just had a session with Luigi for our first IVR task. And I must say I've learnt quite some stuff that has now been cemented give the fact that he's worked on Spring Boot projects before.
- Now somehow comfortable to take on a story by myself.

So new learning for the Day:
-> $ git checkout -b <test1> ... creates and enters into a branch <test1> with everything contained in the branch created from
- when you edit the file while in the test1 branch just add and commit the changes to navigate to another branch without issues.
- if you create another branch from <test1> branch, then it will contain the contents of the branch created from 
- when you push the branch, then you will have only the pushed branch in the remote version control with its changes ready for merging
-> $ git branch -D <branch> ... allows you to DELETE a branch whether it has been pushed already or not.

- Just from a 2hr session for Deployment of the Subscription Service led by Andrew Hylton. 
A very informative session and insightful. 
But as usual, you mess up with it, you get to learn a bunch of stuff regarding how things go.
We are to continue with the session tomorrow.
Leaving for home now.
