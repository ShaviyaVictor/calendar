- So another day in the office, I have a couple of sessions today. I hope I make some progress with my tasks and have a PR created for the same tasks.
- Log4j migration should be done by end of day and know a way forward for the SIF null->account number task with Brown-Wryte and finish or at least do something with Luigi for the PrankCaller task for IVR team
- Today is Downtown chill day.
- The Deployment CD setup for Disney is a whole freaking process. Can blow your mind off for sure! We are having our third 2.5hr session today.
- The 2.5hr session has been cancelled. We are to work on our respective tasks. For the SIF null->account number task, I let it be for now and I embark on the Log4j task with an aim to have it completed by close of business today. Will be working on it with a couple of branches then push the final tested branch over for review and delete the other branches.
- So after today, the next day of work is on Tuesday since August 1st is a public holiday here:- Emancipation Day(a day when Slavery got abolished and hence the Jamaicans got freed from slavery) followed by August 6th when they now got total freedom. This is according to Tarique, my friend. And he really appreciates these stuff as well as Africans and would love to visit Africa one day(West Africa) I pray the Lord help him have that accomplished.
- Onto my task now.

- Another day in the office, today I have like 5 sessions and 2 tasks to complete and could proably get an additional one for IVR.
When I am afraid, I put my trust in the Lord.
Afterall, faith drives away fear and fear drives away faith!
- Just started my 2hr meeting for Production Deployment for Subscription Service that is to go support Disney Apps.
For the Replace null with Account number story task that I am working jointly with Shemar Brown-Write, 
we've hit rock-bottom with Brown saying it's now gotten to a place where we are looking for a pin in a hay-stack.
- Just had a session with Luigi for our first IVR task. And I must say I've learnt quite some stuff that has now been cemented give the fact that he's worked on Spring Boot projects before.
- Now somehow comfortable to take on a story by myself.
.
So new learning for the Day:
-> $ git checkout -b <test1> ... creates and enters into a branch <test1> with everything contained in the branch created from
- when you edit the file while in the test1 branch just add and commit the changes to navigate to another branch without issues.
- if you create another branch from <test1> branch, then it will contain the contents of the branch created from 
- when you push the branch, then you will have only the pushed branch in the remote version control with its changes ready for merging
-> $ git branch -D <branch> ... allows you to DELETE a branch whether it has been pushed already or not.

- Just from a 2hr session for Deployment of the Subscription Service led by Andrew Hylton. 
A very informative session and insightful. 
But as usual, you mess up with it, you get to learn a bunch of stuff regarding how things go.
We are to continue with the session tomorrow.
Leaving for home now.
