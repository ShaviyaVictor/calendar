- Another day in the office, today I have like 5 sessions and 2 tasks to complete and could proably get an additional one for IVR.
When I am afraid, I put my trust in the Lord.
Afterall, faith drives away fear and fear drives away faith!
- Just started my 2hr meeting for Production Deployment for Subscription Service that is to go support Disney Apps.
For the Replace null with Account number story task that I am working jointly with Shemar Brown-Write, 
we've hit rock-bottom with Brown saying it's now gotten to a place where we are looking for a pin in a hay-stack.
- Just had a session with Luigi for our first IVR task. And I must say I've learnt quite some stuff that has now been cemented give the fact that he's worked on Spring Boot projects before.
- Now somehow comfortable to take on a story by myself.

- Just from a 2hr session for Deployment of the Subscription Service led by Andrew Hylton. 
A very informative session and insightful. 
But as usual, you mess up with it, you get to learn a bunch of stuff regarding how things go.
We are to continue with the session tomorrow.
Leaving for home now.
